## Quality

![image3.png](image3.png)

The Quality section provides a tiered system for balancing visual quality against performance.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Global Quality** | Enum | `Medium (Balanced)` | Master quality preset that controls Ray Marching, Self-Shadow, and External Shadow quality together. |

## Global Quality Presets

| Preset | Ray March Steps | Min Step Size | Self-Shadow | External Shadow | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Low** | 128 | 50.0 cm | 3 steps | Off | Mobile/Low-end PC, Maximum performance |
| **Medium** | 256 | 25.0 cm | 6 steps | On (512px) | Recommended for most projects |
| **High** | 512 | 16.0 cm | 8 steps | On (1024px) | High-end PC, Maximum quality |
| **Custom** | Per-section | Per-section | Per-section | Per-section | Independent control per section |

## Custom Quality Mode

When **Global Quality** is set to **Custom**, you can configure each quality section independently. Each section (Ray March, Self-Shadow, External Shadow) has its own quality preset selector.

## Ray March Quality

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ray March Quality** | Enum | `Medium` | Controls ray marching precision. Can be set to Low/Medium/High/Custom. |

When Ray March Quality is **Custom**:

| Setting | Type | Range | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Custom Max Steps** | int32 | 32-1024 | 256 | Maximum ray marching iterations per pixel |
| **Custom Min Step Size** | float | 5.0-100.0 | 25.0 | Minimum distance (cm) between ray samples |

## Self-Shadow Quality

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Custom Shadow Max Distance** | float | 1000-100000 | 50000 | Maximum shadow rendering distance (cm) |

## Performance Impact

- **Max Steps**: Higher values increase GPU cost linearly
- **Min Step Size**: Smaller values improve quality but require more steps
- **Cascade Resolution**: Memory usage scales quadratically (512x512 = 1MB, 1024x1024 = 4MB per cascade)

---

## Smoke Preset

![image10.png](image10.png)

**Smoke Presets** are Data Assets that define per-volume appearance settings. Use presets to create reusable smoke configurations (white smoke, colored smoke, thick/thin smoke, etc.).

### Creating a Smoke Preset

1. In **Content Browser**, right-click
2. Select **Miscellaneous > Data Asset**
3. Choose `IVSmokeSmokePreset` as the class
4. Name it descriptively (e.g., `DA_SmokePreset_WhiteThick`)

### Preset Properties

| Property | Type | Range | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Smoke Color** | FLinearColor | - | (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0) | RGB color of the smoke. Alpha is ignored. |
| **Smoke Absorption** | float | 0.0-1.0 | 0.1 | Light absorption coefficient. Higher values create denser, more opaque smoke. |
| **Volume Density** | float | 0.0-10.0 | 1.0 | Overall density multiplier for this volume. |

### Applying a Preset

1. Select your `AIVSmokeVoxelVolume` actor in the level
2. In the Details panel, find **IVSmoke | Config > Smoke Preset Override**
3. Assign your Smoke Preset data asset

![image11.png](image11.png)

### Preset Examples

| Preset Name | Color | Absorption | Density | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| White Smoke | (0.9, 0.9, 0.9) | 0.1 | 1.0 | Standard smoke grenade |
| Thick Black | (0.1, 0.1, 0.1) | 0.3 | 2.0 | Heavy industrial smoke |
| Red Signal | (0.8, 0.2, 0.1) | 0.15 | 1.2 | Signal/marker smoke |
| Thin Mist | (0.7, 0.7, 0.8) | 0.05 | 0.5 | Light fog/mist effect |

---

## Translucent / Custom Depth

When smoke needs to correctly sort with translucent objects (like fire effect, or glass), use the **Custom Depth** sorting feature.

### The Problem

By default, smoke renders in a single post-process pass. Translucent particles (Niagara/Cascade) may appear incorrectly in front of or behind the smoke regardless of actual depth.

### The Solution: Custom Depth Sorting

1. **Set Render Pass** to `Translucency After DOF`
2. **Enable** `Use CustomDepth Sorting` checkbox (appears only when Translucency After DOF is selected)
3. **Configure particles** to write Custom Depth

### Setup Steps

### Step 1: Configure IVSmoke Settings

1. Go to **Project Settings > Plugins > IVSmoke > Rendering**
2. Set **Render Pass** to `Translucency After DOF`
3. Check **`Use CustomDepth Sorting`**

### Step 2: Configure Translucent Material

![image12.png](image12.png)

For each material that should sort with smoke:

1. Open your Material
2. Type ‘**Custom**’ on search bar in **Details tab**
3. Check **`Allow Custom Depth Writes`**

### Step 3: Enable Custom Depth on Each Components

![image13.png](image13.png)

For each component that should sort with smoke:

1. Select your component from **Details**
2. Go to **Rendering > Advanced**
3. Check `Render CustomDepth Pass`

### Step 4: Enable Project Custom Depth

![image14.png](image14.png)

1. Go to **Project Settings > Engine > Rendering**
2. Set **Custom Depth-Stencil Pass** to `Enabled with Stencil`

### Step 5: Set Opacity Mask Clip Value (Optional)

For proper depth testing across all opacity ranges, you must set a low **Opacity Mask Clip Value** on your particle materials:

1. Open your particle material
2. Set **Opacity Mask Clip Value** to a low value (e.g., `0.01`)
3. This ensures that particles with any visible opacity correctly write to Custom Depth

### How It Works

```
Without Custom Depth:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Scene Color                 │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Smoke (always on top)       │  ← Problem: Ignores depth
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Particles                   │
└─────────────────────────────┘

With Custom Depth Sorting:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Scene Color                 │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Per-pixel depth comparison  │  ← Reads Custom Depth + Scene Depth
│ Smoke OR Particle           │  ← Composites based on depth
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Performance Considerations

| Feature | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Custom Depth Pass | Low (if already enabled) |
| Depth-Sorted Compositing | Medium (additional texture reads per pixel) |
| Particle Custom Depth Output | Low per particle |

**Recommendation:** Only enable Custom Depth sorting when you have translucent particles that must correctly intersect with smoke volumes.

## Editor Preview

![image15.png](image15.png)

The **Editor Preview** feature allows you to preview smoke simulation directly in the editor viewport without entering Play mode.

### Starting Preview

1. Select an `AIVSmokeVoxelVolume` actor in your level
2. In the Details panel, find **IVSmoke | Debug**
3. Ensure **Debug Enabled** is checked
4. Click **Start Preview Simulation**

The smoke will begin simulating through its lifecycle phases (Expansion → Sustain → Dissipation) directly in the editor viewport.

### Stopping Preview

Click **Stop Preview Simulation** to immediately halt the simulation and clear all voxel data.

### Debug Visualization Options

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Debug Enabled** | bool | `true` | Master toggle for all debug features. |
| **Render Smoke In Preview** | bool | `true` | Whether to render the actual smoke visual during preview. |
| **View Mode** | Enum | `Solid Color` | Visualization mode: Solid Color or Heatmap (density-based). |
| **Show Volume Bounds** | bool | `true` | Display the bounding box of the smoke volume. |
| **Show Voxel Mesh** | bool | `false` | Render each active voxel as a cube mesh. **Heavy - use sparingly.** |
| **Show Voxel Wireframe** | bool | `true` | Draw wireframe cubes for active voxels. Lighter than mesh. |
| **Show Status Text** | bool | `true` | Display state, voxel count, and simulation time as floating text. |
| **Debug Wireframe Color** | FColor | Dark Gray | Color for debug wireframes. |
| **Slice Height** | float | 1.0 | Display only voxels below this height (0-1 normalized). Useful for inspecting internal structure. |
| **Visible Step Count Percent** | int32 | 100 | Percentage of simulation steps to visualize. |

### Preview Workflow Tips

1. **Rapid Iteration**: Adjust Volume parameters, click Start Preview, observe results, stop, adjust, repeat
2. **Use Wireframe Mode**: Enable `Show Voxel Wireframe` to see the simulation structure without heavy mesh rendering
3. **Status Monitoring**: Keep `Show Status Text` enabled to track voxel count and current simulation phase

### Limitations

- Editor Preview does not trigger network replication
- Holes created during preview are local only
- Performance in preview may differ from packaged builds

## Best Practices

### Recommended Level Placement

When placing smoke volumes in your level, consider these guidelines:

### Spacing and Distribution

- **Avoid clustering**: Do not spawn many smoke volumes in the same location simultaneously. Overlapping volumes in the same area can cause rendering artifacts and significant performance drops.
- **Stagger activation**: If multiple smoke grenades land near each other, consider staggering their activation times slightly.
- **Use adequate spacing**: Maintain reasonable distance between simultaneously active smoke volumes.

### Volume Sizing

- **Match gameplay needs**: Size your smoke volumes to cover the intended area without excessive overlap.
- **Consider sightlines**: Place smoke to block key sightlines rather than covering entire areas.

### Performance Tips

- **Limit simultaneous volumes**: Keep the number of simultaneously active smoke volumes reasonable for your target hardware.
- **Use appropriate quality settings**: Match quality settings to your target platform.
- **Test with worst-case scenarios**: Test performance with the maximum expected number of simultaneous smoke volumes.
